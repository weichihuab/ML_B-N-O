# Run the code

With the data.json in upper folder (/path_to/ML_B-N_O/), we can build the model directly by
  - python cohesive.py

The outputs include:

  1. feature.csv: 16 composition features for each data point. These features are generated by Matminer's Meredig featurizer.
  
  2. evaluation_cohesive.png: evaluation of the ML model for cohesive energy.
  
  3. feature_importances_cohesive.png: feature importances for the ML model for cohesive energy.
  
  4. rf_cohesive.joblib: ML random forests model for cohesive energy.

Once rf_cohesive.joblib is generated, we can do ML prediction and plot the ternary graph by
  - python ternary_cohesive.py
