# Run the code

With the data.json in upper folder (/path_to/ML_B-N_O/), we can build the model directly by
  - python cohesive.py

The outputs include:

  feature.csv: 16 composition features for each data point. These features are generated by Matminer's Meredig featurizer.
  
  evaluation_cohesive.png: evaluation of the ML model for cohesive energy.
  
  feature_importances_cohesive.png: feature importances for the ML model for cohesive energy.
  
  rf_cohesive.joblib: ML random forests model for cohesive energy.
