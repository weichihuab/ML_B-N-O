# Run the code

With the data.json in upper folder (/path_to/ML_B-N_O/), we can build the model directly by
  - python hardness.py

The outputs include:

  1. feature_hardness.csv: 16 composition features as well as the volumetric density feature for each data point. The composition features are generated by Matminer's Meredig featurizer.
  
  2. evaluation_hardness.png: evaluation of the ML model for hardness.
  
  3. feature_importances_hardness.png: feature importances for the ML model for hardness.
  
  4. rf_hardness.joblib: ML random forests model for hardness.

Once rf_hardness.joblib and rf_density.joblib (in code_volumetric_density) are generated, we can do ML prediction for hardness and plot the ternary graph (ternary_hardness.png) by
  - python ternary_hardness.py
